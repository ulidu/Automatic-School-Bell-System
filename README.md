Please note that you should have installed "VB6 extended runtime setup" that I've included in the "redist" folder (Automatic School Bell\redist) before using the application. Otherwise this program shouldn't able to run.
And also you have to install all the fonts in the folder named "fonts".(Automatic School Bell\Fonts)
